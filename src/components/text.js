I also was taking notice of the trend and got really curios on how computer really work. And since I used to game alot I also got fascinated by how the software or games were coded.",

      "In 2021, I joined IMS to learn software engineering and built small projects like calculators and password generators, which felt like big achievements. In 2022, I enrolled in IMS, learning databases, HTML, and CSS. Though initially hesitant about JavaScript, I overcame that fear. Now, I aim to become a passionate software engineer with a deeper understanding to deliver valuable work.",

Meanwhile I did some research and wrote some 'toy-application' like calculators and password generators. Even though I was building something simple, it really felt like I've built something big and hard.Fast forward to 2022 and I was enrolled in IMS and there were just too many topics that we've learned about. Databases and building static websites with HTML and CSS. These were the main topics at that time. But suddenly I was scared to make some progress like start using Javascript. But it wasn't long before I overcame it.But nevertheless, I aspire to become a software engineer with passion and a deeper level of understanding in order to provide valuable work!",

    long: "At this point I have some experience at programming in general. I mostly used Goland and Javascript, Svelte specifically, and in school we mostly used PHP and Java. I've build some silly websites but I also build some decent apps as well. But I still feel like a beginner since I have no deep understanding of how software actually works under the hood. I still don't know much about Data structures and Algorithms, I still haven't build a complex application to really cover frontend and backend and just other skills and topics like security, network, design pattern etc.",
