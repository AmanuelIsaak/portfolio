      Curiosity
    </h3>
    <p class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      Before 2021 I was not really interested in computers or software. But at that time during the pandemic everyone was<br>
      at home bored and computers were getting bought everywhere. I also was taking notice of the trend and got really curios<br>
      on how computer really work. And since I used to game alot I also got fascinated by how the software or games were coded.<br>

      First steps
    </h3>
    <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      In 2021 I decided to enter <a class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="https://wg.edubs.ch/schulprofil/ims">IMS</a> in order to learn about software engineering. Meanwhile I did some research and wrote some<br>
      "toy-application" like calculators and password generators. Even though I was building something simple, it really felt like I've build something big and hard.<br>
      Fast forward to 2022 and I was enrolled in IMS and there were just too many topics that we've learned about. Databases and building static websites with HTML and CSS<br>
      were the main topics at that time. But suddenly I was scared to make some progress like start using Javascript. But it wasn't look before I overcome it.<br>
      But nevertheless I aspire to become a software engineer with passion and deeper level of understanding in order to provide valuable work!<br>

      Where do I stand now?
    </h3>
    <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      At this point I have some experience at programming in general. I mostly used Goland and Javascript, Svelte specifically, and in school we mostly used PHP and Java.<br>
      I've build some silly websites but I also build some decent apps as well. But I still feel like a beginner since I have no deep understanding of how<br>
      software actually works under the hood. I still don't know much about Data structures and Algorithms, I still haven't build a complex application to really <br>
      cover frontend and backend and just other skills and topics like security, network, design pattern etc.
